        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Brandilyn Cox</h2>
        <h2>Brandi</h2>
        <p>I am currently in the Interdisciplinary degree with Genealogy, Agriculture, and Entrepreneur as my focuses. I'm taking this class just for something to do.
        </p>
        <p>I love a ton of things but don't have the ability to do much anymore since I became disabled.</p>
        <p>I'm married to the most amazing man on earth, Kevin Cox. I have 1 adult bio-son at home, wrapping up his BYUI degree. I have a bonus/adopted daughter (bio-cousin) teen, homeschooled but starting a new-to-us co-op this year so that's been chaotic. I have another bonus daughter, adult, who lives across the country.</p>
        <p>I've been writing websites since the 90s, typing HTML into notepad and uploading to test it. I started because I found out genealogy could be online so I started writing genealogy sites constantly. </p>
        <p>I've been a member my whole life, baptised at 8yo.</p>
        <p>I'm a disabled combat vet and pretty broken, so I just do what I can these days.</p>
