        Business Proposal to the Board of BlackThumb Farms, Inc. for Fiscal Year 2024
      </h4>
      <p>
        This business proposal outlines the plan to start a new business renting out used RVs. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            The business will purchase a used RV, that is less than 10 years old, and rent it out online to generate profits. (Profit Stream A) 
          </li>
          <li>
            The business will also create an online RV rental website and reach out to local RV owners (Listers) who wish to list their own RVs for rent at higher profits, lower costs, and more flexibility. (Profit Stream B)
          </li>
          <li>
            The business will also reach out to local RV owners (Landlords) to offer a full-service rental program, in which the business will obtain the owner's RV and rent it out for them, at a higher fee than handling their own rental, and we would be Rental Property Managers of their RVs. (Profit Stream C)
          </li>
          <li>
            The business will also offer RV parking for area RV owners (Parkers). (Profit Stream D)
          </li>
        </ul>  
      </p>
      <p>
        PROBLEM: Many people want to experience the RV lifestyle, but they either cannot afford to purchase an RV or do not want to commit to the long-term ownership of one. This creates an opportunity for a business to rent out used RVs to people who want to experience the RV lifestyle without having to make a large financial investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLUTION: The proposed business will solve this problem by renting out used RVs to people who want to experience the RV lifestyle without having to purchase an RV. The business will offer a variety of RVs to choose from, including travel trailers, fifth wheels, and motorhomes. The business will also offer a variety of rental options, including daily, weekly, and monthly rentals.
      </p>
      <p>
        TARGET MARKET: The target market for the proposed business is people who want to experience the RV lifestyle without having to purchase an RV, who are adults without children or pets. This includes people who are new to RVing, people who want to try out different types of RVs before they purchase one, and people who only need to rent an RV for a short period of time, possibly business travelers.
      </p>
      <p>
        BUSINESS MODEL: The business will generate revenue by renting out used RVs. The business will charge a daily, weekly, or monthly rental fee, depending on the length of the rental period. The business will also charge a cleaning fee and a security deposit. If the business owns or manages the RV, the business would also deliver, pickup, maintain, and secure the RVs when they are not rented out.
      </p>
      <p>
        MARKETING STRATEGY: The business will market itself through a variety of channels, including online advertising, social media marketing, and word-of-mouth marketing. The business will also partner with local businesses, such as campgrounds and RV dealerships, to reach potential customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS: The business is projected to generate $100,000 in revenue in its first year of operation. The business is expected to be profitable within two years of operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        CONCLUSION: The proposed business has a strong potential for success. The business has a large target market, a viable business model, and a sound marketing strategy. The business is also projected to be profitable within two years of operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        RECOMMENDATION: We recommend that you approve this business proposal and allow us to launch our used RV rental business. We are confident that this business will be successful and that we will be able to generate a significant profit for our investors.

      <h3>Details and Specs</h3>
      <p>
        BACKGROUND: The RV & Camper Rental industry in the US was $356.2 million USD in 2022 with an annualized market growth of 3.3%
      </p>
      <h4>
        Profit Stream A - Purchase used RVs and rent to to customers
      </h4>
      <p>
        The business can purchase a handful of used RVs that are less than 10 years old (2014-2023), for cash. The business can then list those RVs on numerous RV rental websites, such as Outdoorsy. Inside each rental would be marketing material explaining that the renters can rent with us again for cheaper on our own RV rental website, providing the QR Code and URL to the rental website.
      </p>
      <p>
        This stream would bring the most revenue but also the most cost and risk, in that the business would need to purchase and own each RV that is listed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local costs for used RVs on Craiglist: $8500 for a 2024 tiny tow trailer - $461k for a 2022 Tiffin Allegro
      </p>
      <p>
        The business will purchase RV rental insurance through Roamly with Wheelbase, so that rental customers can purchase insurance for the duration of their rental. Having 5+ RVs listed with them offers commercial discounts.
      </p>
      <p class="colored">        
        Estimated average annual revenue per unit: $45,400
      </p>
      <h4>
        Profit Stream B - Create an online RV rental website (similar to Outdoorsy)
      </h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a website utilizing WebBrixx that allows Listers to create their own listings</li>
          <li>Reach out to area RV owners and offer our services</li>
          <li>Contact local RV storage locations to leave brochures for owners</li>
          <li>Leave brochures & business cards at local RV parks (KOA, etc)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p> Competitors:
        <ul>
          <li>Outdoorsy.com</li>
          <li>RVShare.com</li>
          <li>Outwander.com</li>

          <li>RVUSA.com</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets us apart from our competitors is that we are local to Knoxville and East TN. We can provide personalized, hands on, in person customer service, if necessary. We will work WITH the Listers that choose to list with multiple sites, in that we won't try to restrict them from listing elsewhere. We will offer a much discounted rate for Listers who have already listed elsewhere to find business and want to secure their return rental customers at a much higher discount to the renter. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outdoorsy charges 25% of the booking fee plus numerous other small charges that do not transfer to the Listers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We would charge a flat 10% and the Lister would retain 90% of the booking charges.

      <p class="colored">
        Estimated average annual revenue per unit: $4540
      </p>
      <h4>
        Profit Stream C - Become rental property managers for area RV owners (Landlords)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Early idea is to reach out to RV owners who want to earn extra income but do not want to "be involved" in the process. For these "Landlords" the business will become the rental property manager and handle ALL aspects of the rentals. Early estimated fees would be 25-50% of the rental income, depending on services.
      </p>
      <p class="colored">
        Estimated average annual revenue per unit: $22,700
      </p>
      <h4>
        Profit Stream D - Offer RV parking for area RV owners (Parkers)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Utilizing the 15-80 acres available to us, clear small parking areas for each RV. Use high quality tarps to create a shade cover over each RV in order to protect the roof.
      </p>
      <p>
        On average the RV storage parking costs in Knoxville, TN are $600-$21k per year.
      </p>
      <p>
        For parking / storage purposes, approximately 40 RVs can fit in 1 acre
      </p>
      <p class="colored">
        Estimated annual revenue per acre for RV storage / parking: $24k - $850k
      </p>
      <h4>
        PARKING REVENUE: Estimated annual revenue from each RV type (listing vs. managed vs. owned)
      </h4>
      <p> Current local prices range from $45-$599 per night.
