                Profit Stream A - Purchase used RVs and rent to to customers
            </h4>
            <p>
                The business can purchase a handful of used RVs that are less than 10 years old (2014-2023), for cash. The business can then list those RVs on numerous RV rental websites, such as Outdoorsy. Inside each rental would be marketing material explaining that the renters can rent with us again for cheaper on our own RV rental website, providing the QR Code and URL to the rental website.
            </p>
            <p>
                This stream would bring the most revenue but also the most cost and risk, in that the business would need to purchase and own each RV that is listed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Local costs for used RVs on Craiglist: $8500 for a 2024 tiny tow trailer - $461k for a 2022 Tiffin Allegro
            </p>
            <p>
                The business will purchase RV rental insurance through Roamly with Wheelbase, so that rental customers can purchase insurance for the duration of their rental. Having 5+ RVs listed with them offers commercial discounts.

            <h4>
                Profit Stream B - Create an online RV rental website (similar to Outdoorsy)

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a website utilizing WebBrixx that allows Listers to create their own listings</li>
                    <li>Reach out to area RV owners and offer our services</li>
                    <li>Contact local RV storage locations to leave brochures for owners</li>
                    <li>Leave brochures & business cards at local RV parks (KOA, etc)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Competitors:
                <ul>
                    <li>Outdoorsy.com</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            What sets us apart from our competitors is that we are local to Knoxville and East TN. We can provide personalized, hands on, in person customer service, if necessary. We will work WITH the Listers that choose to list with multiple sites, in that we won't try to restrict them from listing elsewhere. We will offer a much discounted rate for Listers who have already listed elsewhere to find business and want to secure their return rental customers at a much higher discount to the renter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Outdoorsy charges 25% of the booking fee plus numerous other small charges that do not transfer to the Listers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We would charge a flat 10% and the Lister would retain 90% of the booking charges.

                Profit Stream C - Become rental property managers for area RV owners (Landlords)
            </h4>
            <p>
                Early idea is to reach out to RV owners who want to earn extra income but do not want to "be involved" in the process. For these "Landlords" the business will become the rental property manager and handle ALL aspects of the rentals. Early estimated fees would be 25-50% of the rental income, depending on services.

            <p>
                Utilizing the 15-80 acres available to us, clear small parking areas for each RV. Use high quality tarps to create a shade cover over each RV in order to protect the roof.
            </p>
            <p>
                On average the RV storage parking costs in Knoxville, TN are $600-$21k per year.
            </p>
            <p>
                For parking / storage purposes, approximately 40 RVs can fit in 1 acre
